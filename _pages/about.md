Hey there!

I'm a neuroscience PhD student at Northwestern University. My current projects involve zapping brains from inside and outside the head to figure out how people form episodic memories. I use intracranial recordings (sEEG/ECoG), direct electrical stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation in conjunction with memory tests to see how ensemble activity rapidly primes the brain to encode or retrieve information.
