Hey there!

I'm a neuroscience PhD candidate at Northwestern University. My current projects involve zapping the brain from inside and outside the skull to figure out how people form episodic memories.

I use intracranial local field potentials (sEEG/ECoG), closed-loop direct electrical stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation in conjunction with memory tests to see how the phase of oscillatory ensemble activity primes the brain to encode or retrieve information.
