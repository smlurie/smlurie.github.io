Hey there!

I'm a neuroscience PhD student at Northwestern University. My current projects involve zapping the brain from inside and outside the skull to figure out how people form episodic memories.

I use intracranial local field potentials (sEEG/ECoG), closed-loop direct electrical stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation in conjunction with memory tests to see how the phase of oscillatory ensemble activity primes the brain to encode or retrieve information. I also develop software for real-time neural signal processing [e.g., <a href="https://github.com/smlurie/Echidna">Echidna CCEP (cortico-cortical evoked potential) Viewer</a>].
